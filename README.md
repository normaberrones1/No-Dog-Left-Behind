No Dog Left Behind

Overview
No Dog Left Behind is an innovative platform designed to streamline the process of adopting pets from rescues and shelters. Our goal is to make it easier for potential adopters to find pets in their area and for animal rescues and shelters to keep their pet listings up-to-date. This project also aims to support agencies that require K9s for various functions, including rehabilitation centers that train dogs for police and service work.

Mission
Our mission is to bridge the gap between rescues/shelters and potential adopters by leveraging online tools to simplify the pet adoption process. Inspired by the challenges faced during my own adoption journey, No Dog Left Behind seeks to ensure that every pet finds a loving home and that no dog is left behind.
