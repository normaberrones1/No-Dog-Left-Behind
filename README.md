About No Dog Left Behind --- While it's still a very new idea and something that stands for something that I'm passionate about, the idea behind No Dog Left Behind is to give Rescues/Shelters be able to more easily update their pets. It's no secret that online has had a huge impact on brick and mortar locations for a lot of different comapnies. So I thought why can't we have a similar concept where people can be able to more easily search for pups in their area. As I've been looking into adopting a few pups myself, it's been a challenge. This project was inspired to make it easier for others as they navigate adding a new family member to their family.
